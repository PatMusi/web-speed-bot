# Web Speed Bot
Twitter bot that will test sites for speed when you copy it on messages that have URLs.

Performance testing is done through [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/) ([API](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/advanced-features/webpagetest-restful-apis), [npm module](https://github.com/marcelduran/webpagetest-api)) and bot replies back with some speed metrics and URL of the test.
